 * Once upon a cyber-time, in the land of API wonder, there was a humble route called 'AuthLogout'.
 * It was the epitome of simplicity, with just a single line of code. In a project brimming with
 * complexity, this little route stood as a beacon of uncomplicated grace. It dutifully ensured
 * that users could bid farewell to txAdmin with ease, never overstaying its welcome.
 * And so, with a single request, users embarked on their journeys, leaving behind the virtual
 * realm, 😄👋 #ByeFelicia
